If there is a problem charging your selected payment method, we may charge any other valid payment method associated with your account.
    You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your account, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. MASK Shopping does sell products for children, but it sells them to adults, who can purchase with a credit card or other permitted payment method.

    <br>REVIEWS, COMMENTS, COMMUNICATIONS, AND OTHER CONTENT
    You may post reviews, comments, photos, videos, and other content; send e-cards and other communications; and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights (including publicity rights), or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable, and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam" or unsolicited commercial electronic messages. You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of a card or other content.

    <br>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COMPLAINTS
    MASK Shopping respects the intellectual property of others. If you believe that your intellectual property rights are being infringed, please follow our Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement.
    <br>RISK OF LOSS
    All purchases of physical items from MASK Shopping are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.
    <br>RETURNS, REFUNDS AND TITLE
    MASK Shopping does not take title to returned items until the item arrives at our fulfillment center. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return. In this situation, MASK Shopping does not take title to the refunded item. For more information about our returns and refunds, please see our Returns Center .
    <br>PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS
    MASK Shopping attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, MASK Shopping does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any MASK Shopping Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by MASK Shopping itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.
    <br>PRICING
    "List Price" means the suggested retail price of a product as provided by a manufacturer, supplier, or seller. We regularly check List Prices against prices recently found on MASK Shopping and other retailers. Certain products may have a "Was Price" displayed, which is determined using recent price history of the product on MASK Shopping.
    With respect to items sold by MASK Shopping, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item sold by MASK Shopping is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Other merchants may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item.
    We generally do not charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process or, for digital products, until we make the digital product available to you.
    <br>APP PERMISSIONS
    When you use apps created by MASK Shopping, such as the MASK Shopping App or Kindle App, you may grant certain permissions to us for your device. Most mobile devices provide you with information about these permissions. To learn more about these permissions, click here .
    <br>SANCTIONS AND EXPORT POLICY
    You may not use any MASK Shopping Service if you are the subject of U.S. sanctions or of sanctions consistent with U.S. law imposed by the governments of the country where you are using MASK Shopping Services. You must comply with all U.S. or other export and re-export restrictions that may apply to goods, software (including MASK Shopping Software), technology, and services.
    <br>OTHER BUSINESSES
    Parties other than MASK Shopping operate stores, provide services or software, or sell product lines through the MASK Shopping Services. In addition, we provide links to the sites of affiliated companies and certain other businesses. If you purchase any of the products or services offered by these businesses or individuals, you are purchasing directly from those third parties, not from MASK Shopping. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant, the offerings of any of these businesses or individuals (including the content of their Web sites). MASK Shopping does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product, and content of all these and any other third parties. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use.
    <br>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
    THE MASK SHOPPING SERVICES AND ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) AND OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE MASK SHOPPING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY MASK SHOPPING ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. MASK SHOPPING MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE OPERATION OF THE MASK SHOPPING SERVICES, OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE MASK SHOPPING SERVICES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE MASK SHOPPING SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.
    TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, MASK SHOPPING DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. MASK SHOPPING DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE MASK SHOPPING SERVICES, INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE MASK SHOPPING SERVICES, MASK SHOPPING'S SERVERS OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SENT FROM MASK SHOPPING ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, MASK SHOPPING WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF ANY MASK SHOPPING SERVICE, OR FROM ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH ANY MASK SHOPPING SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING.
    <br>DISPUTES
    Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any MASK Shopping Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by MASK Shopping or through MASK Shopping.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
    There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.
    To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98501. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, MASK Shopping will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
    We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
    <br>APPLICABLE LAW
    By using any MASK Shopping Service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and MASK Shopping.
    <br>SITE POLICIES, MODIFICATION, AND SEVERABILITY
    Please review our other policies, such as our pricing policy, posted on this site. These policies also govern your use of MASK Shopping Services. We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, Service Terms, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.
